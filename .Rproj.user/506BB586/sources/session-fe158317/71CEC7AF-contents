# Introduction {#sec-intro}


Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to transform raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.
The goal of "R for Data Science" is to help you learn the most important tools in R that will allow you to do data science efficiently and reproducibly, and to have some fun along the way ðŸ˜ƒ.
After reading this book, you'll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data science challenges using the best parts of R.

## What you will learn

Data science is a vast field, and there's no way you can master it all by reading a single book.
This book aims to give you a solid foundation in the most important tools and enough knowledge to find the resources to learn more when necessary.
Our model of the steps of a typical data science project looks something like 

First, you must **import** your data into R.
This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API) and load it into a data frame in R.
If you can't get your data into R, you can't do data science on it!

Once you've imported your data, it is a good idea to **tidy** it.
Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with how it is stored.
In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable and each row is an observation.
Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your efforts on answering questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.

Once you have tidy data, a common next step is to **transform** it.
Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means).
Together, tidying and transforming are called **wrangling** because getting your data in a form that's natural to work with often feels like a fight!
